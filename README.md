# WP-Maintanance-mode
A plugin for wordpress that shows a static Maintanance page

---

This plugin does not have an on and off switch. However, you can simply enable or disable the plugin.
The plugin includes an image roulette feature. This means it shows different backgrounds upon refresh. The backgrounds come from Unsplash and are license-free, found in the folder /images.<br><br>
Otherwise, it is a fairly simple plugin that does exactly what it is supposed to do without unnecessary additions.<br><br>
***Note: I may expand this plugin further in the future. But for now, this is it.***

All the plugins and or themes that i present to you are [privacy focussed, secure and open source](https://github.com/ByAldon/WordPress/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
